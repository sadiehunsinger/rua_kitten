    <p>Terris and I fell in love with this tiny, 7-pound baby kitten from the moment we met her at the Denver Dumb
      Friend's League. She wasn't a baby kitten, of course, she was 9 years old and had just had dental surgery. But she
      wasn't afraid of us. She came straight to us and was so curious about the room. She let us pick her up and hold
      her. She was the third cat we saw that day. And the last.</p>

    <p>We both loved the sound of Scottish names, and since we both have Scottish ancestry (Terris much more strongly
      than me), we decided that we were going to find the perfect Scottish name for her. After multiple translations,
      Rua - for red - stuck. We couldn't leave it at that single-word name, though. Her full name is Madam President
      Rua, Princess of Purth. She's a President and a Princess. It's a thing. </p>

    <p>Rua is basically the best creature in the entire world, but her bodily functions have been less than pleasant.
      When we first got her, she loved to pee on soft things. The vet called it "a substrate preference". Thankfully
      just getting her a second litter box did the trick. Vomit was a continuous problem for a while. And poop. A lot of
      both because the food we were giving her must have been shit or her body isn't equipped to digest it. It went
      straight through her. The poor thing. So we switched from a dry food to a wet food, and the vomiting has
      essentially disappeared. Her poop though, my god. She poops less but it stinks more. She also pees on the wall
      behind her litter box. It's like she has no sense of where her pee is spraying, so it often gets in the crack of
      the baseboard. It's pretty lovely. Not as lovely as her, though, of course. </p>
