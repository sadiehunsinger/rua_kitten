    <p>Terris and I fell in love with this tiny, 7-pound baby kitten from the moment we met her at the <a
        href="https://www.ddfl.org/">Denver Dumb
        Friends' League</a>. She wasn't a baby kitten, of course. She was 9 years old and had just had dental surgery,
      but she
      wasn't afraid of anything. She came straight to us and was so curious about everything in the visiting room.
      She was the third cat we saw that day. And the last.</p>

    <p>We both love the sound of Scottish and Irish names, so we got to work on translating her given name from Taco to
      something a little less edible! Words for "beautiful", "cat", and "love" didn't fit, but Rua for "red" definitely
      felt right. We couldn't leave it at that single-word name, though. Her full name is Madam President Rua, Princess
      of Purth. She's a President and a Princess. It's a thing. </p>

    <p>Rua is basically the best creature in the entire world, but her bodily functions have been less than pleasant.
      When we first got her, she loved to pee on soft things. The vet called it "a substrate preference". Thankfully,
      just getting her a second litter box did the trick. Vomit was a continuous problem for a while. And poop. There
      was a lot of both. The poor thing. We switched from dry to a wet food, and the vomiting essentially ceased. Her
      poop though, my god. She poops less, but it stinks more. She also pees on the wall behind her litter box. She
      sometimes has no sense of where her pee is spraying, so it can gets in the crack of the baseboard. It's pretty
      lovely. Not as lovely as her, of course. </p>
